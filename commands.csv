command,description
ls -lha,List directory contents with file sizes in human-readable form
kubectl get pods, getting a list of all pods in kubernetes
sudo nmap -sU MACHINE_IP,nmap udp port scan. If a port is closed an ICMP port unreachable error is returned. If it is open but does not reply to ICMP messages you will not receive anything and can therefore conclude that such a port is open
nmap -sT MACHINE_IP,nmap tcp scan
sudo nmap -sA MACHINE_IP,nmap ack scan to test firewall configuration. The machine will always respond with a RST message regardless of the port state. But if no RST message is returned it could mean that the firewall is blocking communication to and from the machine.
nmap -e NET_INTERFACE -Pn -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP [optional --spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC],nmap spoofing is useful if you can monitor the general network you are on and see if a ping reply is sent out. It is a way to ensure that the machine you are targeting wont know what the true ip that sent the ping is. If you are on the same subnet you can spoof the mac address as well
nmap -sI ZOMBIE_IP MACHINE_IP,zombie scan where there is an idle host such as printer on the network. You first ping the idle host with nmap -sS ZOMBIE_IP and note the IP ID integer. Afterwards you use the zombie command to the have the idle target ping the host. Lastly you ping the zombie machine again. If the IP ID has been incremented with 2 it means that the target machine responded to the zombies ping and that the port is open.
