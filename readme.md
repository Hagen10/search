## Search Tool
It has two ways of being used
- executing `search` will open a list of all the commands currently stored in commands.csv. Selecting one and pressing enter will exit the program and paste it in the terminal
- executing `search add command description` will save a new command as well as a description to the commands.csv. Example: `search add "git checkout master" "checkouts the master branch of the current git directory"`
